Dodging across a moving train, the wind pelting against you to send you further.

Map07/map08/map09 are actually interesting for racing, though obviously it needs to be MUCH wider and more intricate.

map14's emphasis on switches is to be avoided. Don't have the players backtrack!

Map15 features an area where you walk/jump over wandering enemies as a bridge. Awesome!

No instant-death floors. Ever. EVER.

map19 has an interesting intro, with differently colored platforms leading forward, following a large leap through enemy goalposts.
^- Actually, screw it, all of Map19 is interesting.

Don't do anything like map20. Terrible.

Map22 holds a "waiting room" for the victors to watch the others. Interesting!

Map24 holds multiple paths themed via colors.
^- ...Then does a dick move by only having one matter.

Map27 is set in Void, and has several teleporters between differently-themed areas. No real gameplay effect, but interesting!
^- Also lots of platforms that rise and lower consistently. Very interesting!
^- And an awesome drop over icy water.

Map28 has some interesting designs--a floating fortress connected via ropebridges. Again, no gameplay effect, but interesting.

Map29 has rockettraps, explosives spewing from walls. Very nice 

Map30 is generally just awesome to race around, and holds an incredible finale.

Map32 is incredibly interesting, not just in design but also in function. While the ceiling is incredibly low, it holds some interesting setpieces.
^- Bobbing and weaving through interlayered platforms.
^- Diving through multiple sets of holes in one go.
^- Sharp turns noted by bright arrows.
^- Diving between sets of pillars.
^- Scaling up large walls and then immediately diving right after.

Map34 has an interesting design hampered by invisible walls--lots of (supposedly) open jungle area...then bam. Invisible wall.

Map38 has a three-lap structure that teleports the finishees to a new room. Interesting! Lots of possible applications!
