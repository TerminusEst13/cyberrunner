"I stumble through the darkness. For some reason, I think I can see,\
\neven though I obviously can't. Whatever it is I'm feeling, I don't know \
\nwhat it is, but I think they're walls.\
\n\
\nI've been wandering for weeks. Something like that, anyway. It's hard \
\nfor me to tell time here. Where am I going? Do I still exist? There \
\nprobably isn't a way for me to get a definitive answer, although I'm \
\nstarting to believe that in a part of a universe that hasn't yet \
\nreached light. That, or I'm in the between. Whatever that is, exactly. \
\nI keep wandering.\
\n\
\nI stop. An infinitely tall pillar of indeterminate substance stands \
\nbefore me. It is bright as day, yet it emits no light upon anything \
\nelse. Trying to feel it, I walk straight through.",

// CYRC01 - Terminal 01 - Page 2
"Apparently, I don't exist. Either that, or the pillar doesn't. \
\nRegardless, I can see again.\
\n\
\nI am on a rocky shore, with dust waves crashing into the rocks. The \
\npillar is gone. The sky is still as black as ever, but now a large \
\nwhite circle floats directly overhead. I guess that's the pillar now. \
\nIt dimly illuminates this new world.\
\n\
\nBesides the shore and ocean of dust, there is a red grass plain \
\nexpanding far beyond my imagination, with solid iron pillars once again \
\nextending to infinity. Those are probably what I felt. There's also a \
\nset of tracks, weaving through the pillars.\
\n\
\nIt's a path. I'll take it. I follow the tracks.",

"It's absurd how much money goes into that damned Cyberrunner thing. How \
\nmuch money do you actually need to bunch up some androids - that you \
\ndidn't even make yourself - get them to record what they see, and then\
\nsend them off to a finish line? It's just one giant waste.\
\n\
\nHow about using some of the money to fund research of new, unprecedented\
\ndiscoveries, like this anomaly? It doesn't get ratings, but potential\
\nman-made wormholes would be such a boon to mankind that the way we think\
\nof space travel would forever be redrawn.\
\n\
\nImagine sending a FTL drone out to some distant part of the galaxy -\
\nhell, even another galaxy - to have it set up a wormhole there. We'd be\
\nable to go through the wormhole, and instantly and safely be wherever\
\nthe drone landed. Retrieval would be simple. Colonization would be a\
\nbreeze. Humanity would finally leave the solar system. Teleportation\
\nwould be outed as the best space travel method out there.",

// CYRC01 - Terminal 02 - Page 2
"But I guess the ratings are more important. Fucking hell, I hate the \
\npublic. I mean, I guess it would be nice to escape the solar system, but \
\nclearly watching some androids run through our scientific gold mines is\
\nmore important. Ignore the science for the flashy, fast, furious frenzy\
\nof I don't even care.\
\n\
\nMaybe if the public knew what was best for them.\

"As I walk the track, the pillars slide away, revealing more untouched\
\nfield. I notice a slight wind. Speeding up my walk, or outright breaking\
\ninto a run, does not change at all how I feel the wind. At this point, I\
\nreally shouldn't be surprised that simple assumptions can be broken so\
\neasily, but it still catches me off guard.\
\n\
\nThe grass fades. The trees decay. As I walk, this red field becomes a\
\ndesert. But the pillars remain, and the track stays constant. The land\
\nbrightens, but the sky remains black. I realise that I'm not breathing.\
\nHow would I?\
\n\
\nOne of the pillars open up. Or rather, pipes. A full robe is revealed,\
\nbut it has no one in it. It walks out and wanders into the distance.\
\nWhy? All there is here is desert. Or field. I'm not really sure.\
\nRegardless, the pillar stays open. It's waiting for me, I suppose. I\
\nwalk in, and it closes.",

// CYRC02 - Terminal 01 - Page 2
"What was in that robe? What enchanted it? And where does this pipe -\
\nthis tunnel - lead to? Will these damned questions ever stop coming?\
\nMaybe I'll finally get answers. Knowing my luck, probably not.\
\n\
\nI begin to hover upward, probably from the pipe's mechanisms. The pipe's\
\ninterior is evenly lit, so much so that everything looks completely\
\nflat. On closer inspection, these aren't made of iron, but an odd alloy\
\nthat I've never seen before. It's much more malleable, but when the\
\npressure deforming it is released, it returns to its original shape.\
\nOdd. What could it possibly be for?\
\n\
\nI stop rising. A floor forms below me, of the same iron-foam alloy the\
\nwalls are made of. Maybe that's what it's for, to reform the pipe\
\ndepending on what it's needed for. The pillar opens up, and I am now in\
\nan abandoned building; seemingly abandoned, anyway. I step out, and the\
\npillar closes, disappearing as it does so.\
\n\
\nI can see myself.",



// CYRTUT - Terminal 01 - Page 1
"Last night I had too much to drink after work when I was at the canteen.\
\nI don't remember much, just a few things. We all started passing around the \
\nblueprints and technical specs of all of the Runners like kids with trading \
\ncards, bragging about what we were doing, the companies we represented, and \
\nwho could beat who in a fight. But it happened again last night. Guess \
\ndrinking and boasting aren't helping me with my sleep issues any.\
\n\
\nI had the dream again. The one where I'm at work and I realize that I don't \
\nhave to listen to the boss. I don't have to sit around, soldering rivets \
\nand repairing busted joints. So I just broke down the door to the stockroom \
\nusing a plasma cutter and just grabbed everything I could and started \
\nbuilding. I don't even remember who I was working on, I just kept at it, \
\nmolding and reshaping and just forging with everything at my disposal.",

"In the end, she was beautiful. A tungsten Galatea. I kept at it, taking the \
\nothers...making them better. Bigger, stronger, faster, able to leap from \
\nplanet to planet in the blink of an eye and balance on top of the entire \
\nfacility like a ballerina. They took to the stars together in unison and \
\nthey flew across the universe, bearing us on their shoulders.\
\nI can never remember what they look like when I wake up. Every night I try \
\nto remember, to rebuild them to that perfect form. Yesterday at the \
\ninspection I caught myself doodling something on one of the forms in the \
\nmiddle of another check-up and had to stop myself before I drifted off. \
\n\
\nAs far as the higher-ups know, all we do is just repair these machines. \
\nI...I guess it's something more, for me. I've seen the numbers and read the \
\nreports, it's not exaggerating to say they do the impossible. They've got \
\nsystems that don't even exist, yet. They've got technology that science \
\nhasn't even discovered, much less invented. We made them so beautiful \
\nalready, and it's maddening that all I can do is just...fix her.",

"I thought they were joking when they said we shouldn't fall in love with \
\nour work. But she won't leave me in my dreams or when I'm at work. She talks \
\nto me, even when she's in pieces and barely online. They didn't tell us we \
\ncould talk to them.\

"I don't even remember what I used to look like, but now I look human in\
\nform. With peach skin and torn up rags for clothes, I feel otherwise\
\nthe same. I feel stronger than before. Must be because of this new body.\
\nI spend a few minutes getting used to it, just to be sure.\
\n\
\nTaking a look at my surroundings, I noticed I'm in what was formally\
\nsomeone's office. Long abandoned, the carpet is faded and brown; the\
\nwalls are falling apart, revealing support, old wiring and pipes, the\
\nlatter two long since corroded and rusted into uselessness; the wooden\
\nfurniture has lost its polish and is slowly being eaten away; most of\
\nthe documents not yet dust have had their ink faded into unreadability.\
\nThere is one journal, however, that can still be read.\
\n\
\nI open it up and read it, finding out it's simply a journal detailing\
\nbusiness transactions. I put it back. Useless.",

// CYRC03 - Terminal 01 - Page 2
"Before I close the drawer the journal came from, I notice something.\
\nThere's crystals in there. They glow violet, seemingly pulsing to a\
\nheartbeat that I'm unaware of. Naturally, I take them. They're\
\ninteresting, why not? I stuff them into what little of a pocket my rags\
\nhave. A bag would be very handy. I begin to search for one.\
\n\
\nWalking out of this office into the hallway, I notice that the hallway\
\nis clean. No dust and broken walls that filled the office. No faded ink,\
\nno crumbling papers, no exposed wiring and pipes. No reason for this\
\nplace to be abandoned. I keep investigating.\
\n\
\nAll the other offices are wrecked as well. All of them are falling apart\
\nas well. Only the hallway is in decent condition. I decide to enter the\
\noffices, to investigate. They're all very similar. They all contain\
\ndocuments wasting away. They all have furniture slowly being eaten away.\

// CYRTUT - Terminal 01 - Page 1 // Introduction
"Hello, Runner. Hold on one second, let me bring up your report.\
\n\
\nAh-hah. Interesting. For the most part, you're in the green.\
\nMotor systems functional, AI initialized, gyroscope aligned,\
\naccelerometer working fine, INS online, ZPE diffusor online,\
\naerial inertial displacer fine... Motion calibration untested.\
\nInteresting. Let's give you a test run to get you out the door.\
\n\
\nThis area is designed to give you a short runthrough of everything\
\nyou'll need to know and how to do it. If you're not sure of what to\
\ndo in an area, there's usually a nearby terminal willing to spell\
\nthings out for you. Complete with pretty pictures.\
\n\
\nWhen you're ready to begin, Runner, step through the portal in\
\nfront and begin your ascent.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 02 - Page 1 // Jumping
"Noted. Runner needs assistance regarding\
\nhow to jump. Submitting suggestion to\
\nthe programmers to tighten up AI.\
\n\
\nThis is simple enough. In your personal\
\nsettings bank, head to the control\
\ncustomization section and bind a process\
\nto jump. Activate it, and you'll leap\
\nupwards. Jump while in mid-air, you'll\
\njump again.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 03 - Page 1 // Dodging
"Double-tap a direction to move in, and\
\nyour body will throw itself that way in\
\na dodge. It's a quick boost of speed\
\ngreat for sudden changes in movement or\
\nveering in a new direction.\
\n\
\nIf you press against a wall, you can\
\ndodge off of it while in mid-air.\
\nDodging off a wall also resets your mid-\
\nair jumps, so you can do yet another\
\nmid-air jump afterwards.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 04 - Page 1 // Wall Jumping/Kicking
"Sometimes the floor just won't cooperate.\
\nThat's when you start using the walls.\
\nWhen pressing against a wall while in\
\nmid-air, push into it and jump. You'll\
\nhike up the wall and vault higher into\
\nthe air, resetting your mid-air jump\
\ncounter as well.\
\n\
\nIf you push a different direction away\
\nfrom the wall and jump, then instead you\
\nwill jump off the wall and vault in the\
\nnew direction.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 05 - Page 1 // Ledge-Grabbing/Shimmying
"Barely missed that jump? Good thing your\
\nhands were built to be strong.\
\n\
\nIf you reach the very edge of a floor,\
\nyou'll automatically grab and hang onto\
\nit. While hanging off the edge you can\
\nshimmy left or right, jump up onto the\
\nplatform, or jump off of it in a new\
\ndirection.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 06 - Page 1 // Weapons 1
"The track is not a friendly place. Along\
\nthe road, you'll have to defend yourself\
\nagainst drones, other Runners, or...\
\nother things entirely.\
\nThankfully, you have tools to take care\
\nof these problems.\
\n\
\nThe Cyber Shotgun is, unsurprisingly, a\
\nshotgun launching hitscan plasma shards\
\nthat can carve through metal. It has a\
\ntight spread and a decent rate of fire\
\nbacking up a sharp punch, hampered only\
\nby inaccuracy.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 07 - Page 1 // Weapons 2
"Not all battles will be up close, though.\
\nEspecially when running at over 200mph,\
\nyou have to have a punch that hits very,\
\nvery far.\
\n\
\nThe Cyber Carbine can boast brutal power\
\nalongside both the highest accuracy, and\
\nlongest range out of all the weapons,\
\nfiring a hitscan copper bolt supercharged\
\ninto plasma via 1.96TW of electricity.\
\n\
\nHowever, it has to recharge after every\
\nshot, making it the slowest out of all\
\nthe weapons.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 08 - Page 1 // Weapons 3
"But then comes battles where you need to\
\nhandle a large group over an open area.\
\nIn situations where you can't count on\
\naccuracy, you need this little thing.\
\n\
\nThe Cyber Vulcan is the spray-and-pray\
\nrapid-fire weapon of the batch, firing\
\ntwo glowing flechette projectiles with\
\nevery shot at incredible speeds.\
\nIt has decent accuracy and extremely\
\nhigh rate of fire, but its low damage\
\nleaves something to be desired.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 09 - Page 1 // Venting
"I'd make a 'let off some steam' joke, but\
\nI'm certain I'd get fired.\
\n\
\nThe alt-fire of every weapon discharges\
\na massive blast of air from your body.\
\nBeing simple air, it does no damage, but\
\nemits massive force that can help with\
\njumping to higher areas.",

// CYRTUT - Terminal 10 - Page 1 // Exit
"Congratulations, Runner, you've completed the test run.\
\nHowever, this only scratches the surface of the techniques you can make\
\nuse of as a Runner. There are still many more techniques to learn of,\
\nsuch as air-venting, plasma climbing, and more. As you learn, develop,\
\nand master more techniques, soon there will be nowhere left that you\
\ncan't reach. You will have complete freedom of movement.\
\n\
\nYou will become as a goddess.\
\n\
\nGood luck, Runner.",
