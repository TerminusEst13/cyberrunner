FROM 0.1 TO 0.11:
===================
- Added a new Deathmatch map, CYDM03: Verticle Datapath, by Revae!
- Trimmed a few unused textures.
- Rephrased some obituaries due to incorrect/lame terminology.
- The Shotgun's tracers now show up in non-Doom games.
- Weapon balance has been completely redone using the power of MATH, rather than "what feels right".
 ^-: Carbine now does 180 damage every 50 tics. 180/50 = 3.6, 3.6*35 = average 126 damage a second. 21 damage buff.
 ^-: Shotgun does 10*4(1d3) and 15*3(1d3), 80+90 = 170, 170/40 = 4.25, 4.25*35 = average 148.75 damage a second. 8.75 damage buff.
 ^-: Vulcan does two projectiles with 8 damage every 3 tics. [(2x8)/2]+(8/2) = 12 damage every 3 tics = 4, 4*35 = average 140 damage a second. 35 damage nerf.
 ^-: Vulcan has had its ammo halved in LMS, with 3 tics at 500 ammo being 1500/35 = 42.85[...] seconds of firing. Its radius and height has also been reduced from 8 to 6.
 ^-: Running people over has had its damage boosted from 400 to 500, to ensure sure-kills.
- Running people over no longer can be reflected back and kill the Runner. That was weird.
- Ammo numbers for the Shotgun, Carbine, Purge Rifle, and Hammer have been centered in the bar HUD.
- The Cyberrunner tutorial, racing maps, and deathmatch maps are now accessible from the main menu.
- CYRC02's final teleporter at the end now has proper alignment.
- The HUD now takes Doom's keys into account.
- The weapon's spawn particles have now been removed, which will hopefully result in less crashing for people.
- On initial spawning, the race maps replenish everyone's health and boosts.
