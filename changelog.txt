FROM 0.11 TO 0.12:
===================
- The Cyber Claw now makes its appearance! A laser grapple hook with a range of 4072 units, it latches onto anything it hits and starts pulling the Runner in, allowing them to yank themselves to new areas or simply swing along. It is an optional weapon, activated via cvar of cyber_claw



FROM 0.1 TO 0.11:
===================
- Added a new Deathmatch map, CYDM03: Vertical Datapath, by Revae!
- Trimmed a few unused textures.
- Rephrased some obituaries due to incorrect/lame terminology.
- The Shotgun's tracers now show up in non-Doom games.
- Weapon balance has been completely redone using the power of MATH, rather than "what feels right".
 ^-: Carbine now does 180 damage every 50 tics. 180/50 = 3.6, 3.6*35 = average 126 damage a second. 21 damage buff.
 ^-: Shotgun does 10*4(1d3) and 15*3(1d3), 80+90 = 170, 170/40 = 4.25, 4.25*35 = average 148.75 damage a second. 8.75 damage buff.
 ^-: Vulcan does two projectiles with 8 damage every 3 tics. [(2x8)/2]+(8/2) = 12 damage every 3 tics = 4, 4*35 = average 140 damage a second. 35 damage nerf.
 ^-: Vulcan has had its ammo halved in LMS, with 3 tics at 500 ammo being 1500/35 = 42.85[...] seconds of firing. Its radius and height has also been reduced from 8 to 6.
 ^-: Running people over has had its damage boosted from 400 to 500, to ensure sure-kills.
- Running people over no longer can be reflected back and kill the Runner. That was weird.
- Ammo numbers for the Shotgun, Carbine, Purge Rifle, and Hammer have been centered in the bar HUD.
- The Cyberrunner tutorial, racing maps, and deathmatch maps are now accessible from the main menu.
- There is now a Quake-style when-shot-connects sound indicator, toggled via cyber_cl_hitindicator.
- Various tweaks across both CYRC01 and CYRC02, adjusting textures and tweaking the ACS.
- The race maps now refill health and boosts upon enter.
- cyber_cl_particles has been removed, in an attempt to combat the crashing that some people are having.
- For vanilla jumping maps with combat, ammo drops have been added for the weapons. They replace the big ammo packs and have about a quarter of the weapon's total ammo capacity.
- Nothing has changed in CYRTUT.
- With Zandronum's update to 1.1, the Shotgun now has FBF_NORANDOM for normalized damage.
- CYDM02 has had the side nodes removed.
- CYRC02 has been rendered more open for easier navigation, with temporary additional structures for easier traversing until it can be put later in the map rotation.
- cyber_changelog has been implemented.
